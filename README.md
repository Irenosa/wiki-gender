Project for Applied Data Analysis 2019: Study of linguistic biases in the overview of biographies about men and women in the English Wikipedia

# Title ## TODO: find a nice title

# Abstract
## TODO: 
Wikipedia has become one of the greatest sources of information in the last decade. Among its articles, more than one million correspond to biographies. Our aim is to analyze how men and women are portrayed and if there exist any biases in the language used to describe them.  

By using the biography articles in English Wikipedia, the goal of this study is to look for possible asymmetries in the way a person is described based on its gender. Moreover, we want to study the relation between these possible biases and the context in which this person is described: year, topic to which the person is related, culture, etc. with the idea of better understanding gender biases in our language. 



# Research questions
## TODO: add more questions
- Is there an asymmetry in the way men and women are portrayed in the wikipedia?
- Have we changed along time the choice of words use to describe people? 
- Are there sectors/topics more likely to introduce language biases than others? 
- How subjective are the adjectives used to describe the people?


# Dataset
## TODO: complete information: size, local/cluster/, etc. 
We will use the overview of biographies about men and women in the English Wikipedia. The overview (also known as lead section) is the first section of an article. According to Wikipedia, it should stand on its own as a concise overview of the articleâ€™s topic. Wikipedia editors need to focus on what they consider most important about the person, and biases are likely to play a role in this selection process.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
## TODO: complete information and define dates
- collect the dataset (select from the cluster the biographies, save them local)
- take overview from men and women (define the year maybe? )
- set up initial github structure
- explore the dataset and perform an initial NLP analysis
- agree on the metrics
- try out different tools and metric
