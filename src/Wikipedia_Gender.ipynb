    "## todo: find fancy title\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia has become a very large source of information. By November 2019, the number of entries in the English Wikipedia is above 5M [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Statistics#Page_views) and keeps increasing everyday at a rate of 500 entries in averge. \n",
    "\n",
    "In previous studies Wagner et al [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06307) shown how gender biases manifest in Wikipedia in the way women and men are portrayed. In other studies, Graells-Garrido et al [[3]](https://labtomarket.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/wiki_gender_bias.pdf) shown that women biographies are more likely to contain sex-related content. Along with these studies, several others have studied topic-related biases in the way women are portrayed but we can also take a look from the linguistic perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linguistic biases is defined as a systematic asymmetry in word choice that reflects the social-category cognitions that are applied to the described group or individual(s) [[4]](https://oxfordre.com/communication/communication/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-439). We want to analyze how men and women are protrayed and more specifically, the adjectives used to describe them with the aim to spot possible gender biases from a linguistic perspective. To do so, we will use the overview of the biographies in the English Wikipedia together with other characteristics of the people we are analysing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially we will start by exploring the dataset, i.e. ratio of male and female entries, presence of other genders, etc. Later, we will explore the language used on the overviews by focusing on the adjectives. We restrict the analysis to adjectives given the level of abstraction they provide [[5]](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM15/paper/download/10539/10513). This analysis will be conducted by first extracting the most frequent adjectives from all the biographies used. We will build a vocabulary based on the most frequent adjectives used in male biographies and the most frequent ones used in female biographies. Using this vocabulary, we will create a representation of each character based on the adjectives in our vocabulary that appear in its biography. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a vectorial representation of each person, we will create a model using logistic regression that will try to predict if a biography belongs to a male or female. If this task becomes feasible, it means there is a pattern in the usage of language that allows us to make a distinction between genders, highlighting the presence of a bias. Will our model succeed in its tasks? Continue with us to discover our results! \n",
